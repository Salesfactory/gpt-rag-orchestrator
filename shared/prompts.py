Example 1:

Artificial Intelligence has revolutionized healthcare in several ways [[1]](https://medical-ai.org/research/impact2023) through improved diagnosis accuracy and treatment planning. Machine learning models have shown a 95% accuracy rate in detecting early-stage cancers [[2]](https://cancer-research.org/studies/ml-detection?year=2023). Recent studies indicate that AI-assisted surgeries have reduced recovery times by 30% [[3]](https://surgical-innovations.com/ai-impact?study=recovery).

Example 2:

The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare has led to significant advancements across various domains:

1. **Diagnosis and Disease Identification:** AI algorithms have significantly improved the accuracy by 28% and speed by 15% of diagnosing diseases, such as cancer, through the analysis of medical images [[1]](https://healthtech.org/article22.pdf?s=aidiagnosis&category=cancer&sort=asc&page=1).
2. **Personalized Medicine:** Analyzing a 2023 global survey of 5,000 physicians and geneticists, AI enables the development of personalized treatment plans that cater to the individual genetic makeup of patients [[2]](https://genomicsnews.net/article23.html?s=personalizedmedicine&category=genetics&sort=asc).
3. **Drug Discovery and Development:** A report from PharmaTech Insight in 2023 indicated that companies employing AI-driven drug discovery platforms cut their initial research timelines by an average of 35%[[3]](https://pharmaresearch.com/article24.csv?s=drugdiscovery&category=ai&sort=asc&page=2).
4. **Remote Patient Monitoring:** Wearable AI-powered devices facilitate continuous monitoring of patient's health status[[4]](https://digitalhealthcare.com/article25.pdf?s=remotemonitoring&category=wearables&sort=asc&page=3).

Each of these advancements underscores the transformative potential of AI in healthcare, offering hope for more efficient, personalized, and accessible medical services. The integration of AI into healthcare practices requires careful consideration of ethical, privacy, and data security concerns, ensuring that these innovations benefit all segments of the population.

---

### EXAMPLES OF SUCCESSFUL CREATIVE BRIEFS

#### Example 1: Hinge – Dating App

**Business Problem**  
Hinge was struggling with product adoption. The competition was tough, and consumers didn’t perceive much difference among the alternatives.

**What Are We Asking the Customer to Do?**  
Download the Hinge App with the hope of finding a partner.

**Who’s the Prime Prospect?**  
Singles who see dating apps as a single merry-go-round.

**What is the Prime Prospect’s Problem?**  
65% of single people don’t want to be single for a long time; they want a partner for the long term.

**Know the Brand**  
Hinge is the only dating app made to be deleted.

**Break the Boredom Barrier**  
Success for most apps means they become part of daily life, but for Hinge, success is when users no longer need it.

> **Why it works**: It taps into the tension that success means users eventually stop using the app entirely.

---

#### Example 2: Lysol – Disinfectant

**Business Problem**  
We aim to rejuvenate consumer interest as sales dip. Despite Lysol leading the market, the disinfectant category itself was losing steam.

**What Are We Asking the Customer to Do?**  
Increase Lysol usage by 20%.

**Who’s the Prime Prospect?**  
Mothers who see germ-kill as overkill.

**What is the Prime Prospect’s Problem?**  
Moms (90%) want the best protection for their kids but don’t want to feel overprotective.

**Know the Brand**  
Lysol’s protection is as resilient and caring as a mother’s love.

**Break the Boredom Barrier**  
Align Lysol with a mother’s innate instinct to protect her child.

> **Why it works**: It highlights a universal truth—mothers’ desire to safeguard children—creating emotional resonance.

---

#### Example 3: Chrysler – Automaker

**Business Problem**  
In 2010, after a bailout and a new partnership with Fiat, Chrysler aimed to win back American consumers with three new products.

**What Are We Asking the Customer to Do?**  
Reshape perceptions and re-establish Chrysler as a respected, desirable brand, thereby boosting sales.

**Who’s the Prime Prospect?**  
Ambitious professionals who stay true to their roots.

**What is the Prime Prospect’s Problem?**  
They often prefer imported cars for perceived quality, even though they value American heritage.

**Know the Brand**
